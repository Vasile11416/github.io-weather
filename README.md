# github.io-weather

Imagine yourself riding the Subway to work. Standing next to the door, you notice other commuters boarding with umbrellas dripping from rain. Did you pack an umbrella? Better check the weather. As you open the app, your Geolocation shows rain but in background their is a recently uploaded photo of a rainbow which gives you a glimpse of hope. 

The idea is to drive user engagement by allowing regular users to submit images of weather, landscape, buildings, and other elements that define intrinsic nature of the respective city, as a background for the next time you want to check the weather.
