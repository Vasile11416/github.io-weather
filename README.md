# github.io-weather

Imagine yourself riding the Subway from Queens to Manhattan. Standing next to the door, you notice other commuters are boarding with umbrellas that are dripping from rain. Did you pack an umbrella? Better check the weather. As you open the app, your Geolocation shows that it's raining but in background their is a recently uploaded photo of a rainbow which gives you a glimpse of hope. 

Sure, you can look at the raidar for when the rain is going to pass. But so does every other app, so how are we going to be different?

... by engaging users and creating a community of content creators. 

The idea is to grow user engagement by allowing regular users to submit images of weather, landscape, buildings, and other elements that define the intrinsic nature of the respective city, as a background for when a person checks the weather.
